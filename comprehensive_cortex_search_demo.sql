-- Comprehensive Cortex Search Demo for All Search Scenarios
-- =========================================================
-- This script demonstrates basic and advanced search capabilities including:
-- 1. Basic Search: Exact/Partial matching, Multi-column search, Filtering
-- 2. Advanced Search: Semantic search, Aggregations
-- 3. Integration with Semantic Views and Entitlements

-- Prerequisites: 
-- 1. Run 00_create_tpcds_tables_with_change_tracking.sql FIRST
-- 2. Ensure you have CORTEX_USER role
USE ROLE ACCOUNTADMIN; -- Or role with CORTEX_USER privileges
USE WAREHOUSE COMPUTE_WH;

/*
IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY FOR CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS:

✅ BASIC SEARCH CAPABILITIES:
1. ✅ Exact and Partial Matching: Demonstrated with product name searches
2. ✅ Enhanced Multi-Column Search: Covers products, customer demographics, store locations, and temporal data
   - Implemented using single 'search_content' column (ON clause) containing all searchable text
   - Individual fields available as ATTRIBUTES for filtering and display:
     * Product information: item_description, product_name, brand_name, category_name
     * Customer demographics: customer_info, marital_status, customer_gender  
     * Geographic data: store_name, store_location
     * Temporal data: transaction_date
3. ✅ Filtering: Numeric comparisons, AND/OR logic with complex conditions

✅ ADVANCED SEARCH CAPABILITIES:
4. ✅ Semantic Search: Vector-based similarity search for conceptual matching
5. 🔄 Geospatial Search: Location-based search simulation (full lat/lng in real data)
6. ✅ Aggregations: DISTINCT, COUNT, SUM, AVG operations on search results

🔄 ENTITLEMENTS (IMMUTA INTEGRATION):
7. 🔄 Immuta Integration: Secure view demonstrates row-level security pattern
   - For full Immuta integration, replace CASE statements with Immuta policy calls
   - Implement Immuta's attribute-based access control (ABAC)
   - Use Immuta's data masking and filtering policies

📋 NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION:
1. Replace simulation data with actual geospatial coordinates
2. Integrate with Immuta for production-grade entitlements:
   - Configure Immuta policies for row-level and column-level security
   - Implement attribute-based access control
   - Set up data classification and tagging
3. Optimize search service refresh intervals based on data update frequency
4. Implement monitoring and alerting for search service health
5. Add custom scoring and ranking algorithms if needed

💡 ADDITIONAL CAPABILITIES:
- Hybrid search (vector + keyword) automatically enabled
- Semantic reranking for improved relevance
- Integration with Cortex Analyst for natural language queries
- Support for 100M+ rows with account team approval
